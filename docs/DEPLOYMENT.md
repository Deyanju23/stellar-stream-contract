# Deployment

This covers deploying the `stream` contract to Stellar testnet. Mainnet is the
same sequence with `--network mainnet`, but do not deploy to mainnet while the
contract is unaudited (see `SECURITY.md`).

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (auto-applied via `rust-toolchain.toml`, target
  `wasm32v1-none`)
- Stellar CLI **v25.2.0 or newer** (v28.x recommended). `soroban-sdk` v28
  refuses a plain `cargo build`, so `stellar contract build` is required. The
  prebuilt binary from the [stellar-cli releases](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli/releases)
  is faster than `cargo install --locked stellar-cli`.
- A funded testnet identity

```bash
stellar keys generate --global alice --network testnet --fund
stellar keys address alice
```

## Build

```bash
make build
# → target/wasm32v1-none/release/stellar_stream.wasm
```

## Deploy and initialize

The contract has no constructor and no dependencies, so the sequence is short:
deploy, then `init` once. Run these in order and keep the printed contract ID.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

NETWORK=testnet
SOURCE=alice
WASM=target/wasm32v1-none/release/stellar_stream.wasm

# 1. Deploy the wasm. The contract ID is printed and is the only output we keep.
echo "Deploying..."
CONTRACT_ID=$(stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm "$WASM" \
  --source "$SOURCE" \
  --network "$NETWORK")
echo "STREAM_CONTRACT_ID=$CONTRACT_ID"

# 2. Initialize with the admin address (the deployer, here).
ADMIN=$(stellar keys address "$SOURCE")
echo "Initializing with admin $ADMIN ..."
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ID" \
  --source "$SOURCE" \
  --network "$NETWORK" \
  -- init \
  --admin "$ADMIN"

echo
echo "================= COPY THESE ================="
echo "STREAM_CONTRACT_ID=$CONTRACT_ID"
echo "VITE_STREAM_CONTRACT_ID=$CONTRACT_ID"
echo "=============================================="
```

The final block is the single source of truth for the address. Paste
`STREAM_CONTRACT_ID` into the application repository's `.env.local`, and into
the hosting platform's environment variables. Both repositories must refer to
the same ID for the same network.

## Verify

```bash
stellar contract invoke --id "$CONTRACT_ID" --source "$SOURCE" --network "$NETWORK" \
  -- get_stream --stream_id 0
# Expected: an error (StreamNotFound) before any stream is created.
```

Create a stream on testnet to confirm end to end, then check the events in a
block explorer (e.g. `https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/$CONTRACT_ID`).

## Recording the deployment

After a successful deploy:

1. Add the contract ID to the release notes for the matching version tag.
2. Add the explorer link to the README's interface section.
3. Update the application repo's environment variables.

## Redeploying

The contract is immutable and `init` can run only once. A behavioral change
requires a new deployment with a new contract ID; existing streams stay on the
old contract. Migrating live streams is not supported and is out of scope.
